# Random Math Stuff in Rust

This project does not have any goals.
I will add some more or less useful math related stuff to this, so it can be reused in other projects.

## Overview
Currently implemented structs and methods.
- `Rational` struct
  - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^)
  - Equations and orders (==, <=, >=, <, >)
  - Greatest common divisor and least common multiple
  - Simplification for reducible fractions
  - Evaluation
- `GaussianIntegers` struct
  - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
  - Equations (==)
  - Norm and complex conjugate
  - Greatest common divisors and least common multiples

## Future Additions
- Polynomials
- Complex numbers
- Matrices

## TODOs
- `is_prime` method for `GaussianIntegers`
