# Random Math Stuff in Rust

This project does not have any goals.
I will add some more or less useful math related stuff to this, so it can be reused in other projects.

## Overview
Currently implemented structs and methods.
- Rational struct
  - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^)
  - Equations and orders (==, <=, >=, <, >)
  - Greatest common divisor and least common multiple
  - Simplification for reducible fractions
  - Evaluation

## Future Additions
- Gaussian numbers
- Complex numbers
- Matrices

## TODOs
